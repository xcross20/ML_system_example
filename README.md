## 🔍 Technical Deep Dive

### Algorithm Selection Rationale
**Why Classical ML over Deep Learning:**
- Faster training and inference (sub-200ms latency requirements)
- Better interpretability for business stakeholders
- More stable behavior with limited training data
- Easier integration with existing business logic
- Lower computational requirements for real-time deployment

### Optimization Strategy
**Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization:**
```python
# Objective function balances multiple metrics
primary_score = results['avg_profit']              # Business impact
risk_adjusted = results['sharpe_ratio'] * 0.1      # Risk consideration  
consistency = (results['win_rate'] - 0.5) * 10     # Reliability
robustness = -results['max_drawdown'] * 0.05       # Drawdown penalty

comprehensive_score = primary_score + risk_adjusted + consistency + robustness
```

### Production Considerations
- **Monitoring**: Real-time performance tracking with automated alerts
- **Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation
- **Scalability**: Designed for horizontal scaling with Celery workers
- **Maintainability**: Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
